    },
    {
      "question": "Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
      "answer": "Supervised learning involves labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is overfitting, and how can you prevent it?",
      "answer": "Overfitting happens when a model learns noise instead of the pattern. Techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and pruning can help prevent it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a convolutional neural network (CNN) work?",
      "answer": "A CNN extracts spatial features using convolutional layers followed by pooling and fully connected layers for classification."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are some common activation functions used in deep learning?",
      "answer": "ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Softmax are commonly used activation functions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you describe a challenging project you've worked on?",
      "answer": "One of the most challenging projects I worked on involved building an NLP-based chatbot. It required extensive fine-tuning of transformer models and optimizing response generation for a better user experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle pressure and deadlines?",
      "answer": "I prioritize tasks, break them into smaller steps, and set realistic deadlines. I also use project management tools to stay on track and ensure timely delivery."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are your strengths and weaknesses?",
      "answer": "My strengths include problem-solving, adaptability, and teamwork. One weakness I am working on is delegating tasks more effectively instead of handling everything myself."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where do you see yourself in five years?",
      "answer": "I see myself taking on a leadership role in AI research and development, contributing to groundbreaking projects, and mentoring aspiring AI engineers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you have any questions for us?",
      "answer": "Yes, I would like to know more about the team I would be working with and the current projects you are focusing on."
